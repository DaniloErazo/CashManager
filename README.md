## Program description

As it's explained in the About paragraph, the main use of Cash Manager is to help the user to organize their money through the registration of each money movement,
this means that there are three main categories of money relations: money entry, spending and saving. The user can define all the money accounts that they use, such as debit, credit,
pocket money etc, each bill will have the money entry, spending and saving movements registered. For these money relations, the user can define a category to see specifically how
they spend the money. In addition to this, there's a graphic analysis of the data
